        "body" : "Also, this breaks from the [Decoration Protocol 0.1.0](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/decoration-protocol.html) with having the hover message being `MarkupContent` rather than `MarkedString`. I can update the docs, however, how do we version the decoration protocol? Do we need to keep history of the v0.1.0, or am I ok to just update it and make it v0.2.0? After we figure this out, I'll also need to update the vs code and coc-metals clients to match this.\r\n\r\nThis is also causing the lsp integration and unit tests to fail because we are just looking at the raw string. However, I don't really see this any different than the other hovers, so I think it actually make sense to surround it with ````scala` tics. Thoughts?",

I've gone ahead and updated the decoration protocol docs and updated the changelog just in case someone was using the protocol.\r\n\r\nI also updated the worksheet suite to include the new hover text having ```scala tics. I've tested this manually to ensure there is no regression in the way things appear in both VS Code an coc-metals. As far as I can tell, it behaves exactly the same.",

Maybe we should have the client send the version it is using? And send one or the other (MarkupContent or MarkupString)?\r\n\r\nMight be more effort to change it than it's worth, we might need to remove MarkedString at some point, but s it deprecated itself?",
