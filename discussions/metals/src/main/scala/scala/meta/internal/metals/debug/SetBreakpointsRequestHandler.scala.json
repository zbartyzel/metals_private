        "body" : "> The logic you say I am reimplementing is required for the library sources anyway, since bloop solution works only for workspace sources.\r\n  \r\nYes, the whole reason why we have `dap-fqcn` is so that IDEs that manage library sources can pass in the resolved fully qualified class names.\r\n  \r\n>  I don't see a reason for falling back to bloop and not using it also for user-defined sources. It does not mean there is no such reason but only that I don't see it currently - can you help me in this regard?\r\n  \r\nYes, the point I'm trying to make is that the logic for library sources is necessary since Bloop doesn't support it. But the logic for workspace sources isn't. There is a reference implementation that it's as good as it gets: it's using the same resolution mechanism the JVM uses for debugging (what's happening under the hood is that the JVM gets our fully qualified class name we pass it and undoes some of the work Bloop has done and finds the class file the loaded class was loaded from in the classloader).\r\n  \r\nAt a high level, the process looks like this:\r\n  \r\nBloop: `$WORKSPACE_SOURCE_FILE` -> `$WORKSPACE_CLASS_FILE` -> `$FQCN` ->\r\nJVM: `$FQCN` -> `$WORKSPACE_CLASS_FILE`\r\n  \r\nThe JVM uses the `LineNumberTable` of the `$WORKSPACE_CLASS_FILE` to correctly set the breakpoint. This is why it's so important that `WORKSPACE_CLASS_FILE` matches the one the JVM picks and why the Bloop implementation is the source of the truth -- because it mimics exactly the logic of the JVM.\r\n  \r\nWhat Metals is doing here might be correct based on the semantic-level information you have. But it's creating a layer of indirection that should be avoided as it could produce issues or inconsistent results in the future. I think it's a good practice to rely on the source of truth if it's possible and in this case it is.",
