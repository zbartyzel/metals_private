I'm just not convinced that on the client side if we are using `testFile` or `testTarget`, there shouldn't really be a reason why we can't send along uri since it should be quite easy to. Do you think this might be an issue from VS Code if someone is trying to trigger from like the side panel or something? I don't think it's unreasonable to just expect a uri.",

        "body" : "We should be able to always send a URI - especially if we start from a command. The only exception would be if we wanted to have a `launch.json` configuration that would just run anything in the current file. This would allow to just use the existing shortcut for debug (F5), but on the other hand we can always add a separate command for that and `launch.json` might be a hack. So maybe leave it out for now and I will see how best to implement it on the vs code side.",
