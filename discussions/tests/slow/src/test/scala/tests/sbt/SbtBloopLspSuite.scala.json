        "body" : "They still are in `.metals/readonly` but the path became much longer - `.metals/readonly/dependencies/sbt-${version}-sources.jar/sbt/Keys.scala`.\r\nHonestly, it was easier to fix tests by leaving these paths without full prefix than investigating the right one per every test. Anyway, there isn't a lot of meaning in seeing them.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think it might be annoying to update jar names in these paths in case if some dependency version will be changed in tests",
