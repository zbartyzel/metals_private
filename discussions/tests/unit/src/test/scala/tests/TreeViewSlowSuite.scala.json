I'm not sure yet if it's worth the effort, we similarly don't have many automated tests for features like the doctor. I feel like it might be good to test a few workflows however:\r\n\r\n- importing a build triggers a reload on project and library explorers\r\n- compiling a source triggers a reload on the project explorer for that given build target\r\n- dynamic compile progress updates should not be sent when the compile view is not visible",
