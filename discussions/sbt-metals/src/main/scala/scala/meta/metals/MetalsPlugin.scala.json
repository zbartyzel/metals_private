        "body" : "@ckipp01 what about this? I think this might have been the actual problem, we should not set `semanticdbCompilerPlugin` if we don't currently support the given scala version. If a user had the Metals plugin and `semanticdbEnabled := true` then we would have replaced the original without actually needing to do it. So it would break user's builds even though Metals does not support the given version. ",
